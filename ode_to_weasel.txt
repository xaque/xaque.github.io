Surrounded by corpses upon my ivory throne, watching the heat death of all things creep over my domain as I, for the first time, begin to question whether a being with no soul can truly die, or if I'll feel the onset of nothingness and simply exist in a deathly state for all time, feeling the crushing pressure of nothingness and hoping daily that a new universe will come, giving me a new kingdom to conquer or the sweet release of a cessation to my own flawed existence.
